To sustain this project, I use what I've learned from previous big projects: 

- Set up a production routine.
- Keep the workflow simple.
- Rely on the routine and workflow when mental bandwidth is limited.

Photos are shot as JPG, cropped 1:1 in Photo Mechanic and uploaded to Dropbox before sharing via mobile phone. Any notes or captions are stored in TXT files alongside the images.

## Work fast

This project has a funny relationship with time.

When I'm at the ranch, work doesn't stop for the photogenic moments. I'm not at the ranch to take pictures. That's a privilege. It's not my job.

During a break (or, more likely, after I'm done working for the day), I take time for pictures. Moments appear and then disappear like a bobcat moving through the tall grass. I work fast.

Even so, I have to tell my story using subjects that don't scare off. Farm work can get pretty loud.

I find subjects elsewhere on my own time, too.

Very few of these photos were made when I first encountered the scene. Many are made seasons later. I've got time.



## Atomic unit

New for this project is the "atomic unit" structure. 

This was suggested to me by a friend, a designer. In design, this approach is used as a way to create a system that scales gracefully and efficiently. You divide information, content and structures into their most basic pieces and build out. (*See this article at [A List Apart](https://alistapart.com/article/language-of-modular-design) for more.*)

For Briars, the atomic unit is a dairy entry – one photo and any notes I'll need for caption writing. By using this model to organize my project, I hoped to:

- Jump between social media platforms, i.e. Instagram, WeChat etc
- Switch between languages, i.e. Chinese and English
- Scale the project up over time

It has proved to be an invaluable conceptual tool, even if it shakes out a little differently when using pictures. 

When I started this project I had no idea where it would go, or that it'd still be growing years later. If I had tried to cram Briars into a traditional structure, like a photo essay, things would have fallen apart ages ago.

## Touchscreen?

Although the first 3 years-worth of images were made with cell phones, I switched to a hand-me-down Nikon point and shoot. It has an optical zoom. Most importantly, I can quickly adjust exposure settings using control wheels without having to take off my work gloves.

It's probably obvious but electronics don't like sweat, dust or having fence posts dropped on them. That wee Nikon has survived cow snot, a toothy kiss from a copperhead and the kind of storms that set off the alarm on your wx radio.

I keep the camera close by – either stowed in a ziplock bag in my pocket, or in a small Pelican case alongside my tools – because a camera is useless if you don't have it when you need it.



## Keep learning

In addition to the usual field guides, [iNaturalist,](https://www.inaturalist.org/) as well as the Texas Master Naturalists and Ag extension have been great resources for learning more about the ecosystem processes happening in front of me.



## Recharge

During a visit, my childhood Chinese teacher gives me a notebook filled with details from the ink and brush paintings of [Qi Baishi.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qi_Baishi)

As a kid, Qi's crickets and cicadas were my favorite. His work was so different to anything I'd ever seen. It made me smile. It still does.

My old teacher doesn't know anything about that. Nevertheless, when she hands me that notebook, she sparks an idea.

When feel like I can't possibly come up with another picture, I flip through that notebook and ask myself how Qi Baishi might see the view.

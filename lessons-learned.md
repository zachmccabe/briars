To sustain this project, I use what I've learned from previous big projects: 

- Set up a production routine.
- Keep the workflow simple.
- Rely on the routine and workflow when mental bandwidth is limited.

Photos are shot as JPG, cropped 1:1 in Photo Mechanic and uploaded to Dropbox before sharing via mobile phone. Any notes or captions are stored in TXT files alongside the images.

## Work fast

I'm not at the ranch to take pictures. That is a privilege, it's not my job.

When I'm at the ranch, work doesn't stop for the photogenic moments: *A bobcat quiet as a ghost in the tall grass. The first morning the grama grass blossoms. A supercell building on the horizon.* When I do take a break, moments appear and disappear like that bobcat. I work fast.

Typically, I find a way to tell my story using subjects that don't scare off. I find subjects elsewhere on my own time, too.

Very few of the photos you've seen from this project were made when I first encountered the scene. Many are made seasons later. I've got time.


## Atomic unit

New for this project is the "atomic unit" structure. 

This was suggested to me by a friend, a designer. In design, this approach is used as a way to create a system that scales gracefully and efficiently. You divide information, content and structures into their most basic pieces and build out. (*See this article at [A List Apart](https://alistapart.com/article/language-of-modular-design) for more.*)

For Briars, the atomic unit is a dairy entry – one photo and any notes I'll need for caption writing. By using this model to organize my project, I hoped to:

- Jump between social media platforms, i.e. Instagram, WeChat etc
- Switch between languages, i.e. Chinese and English
- Scale the project up over time

It has proved to be an invaluable conceptual tool, even if it shakes out a little differently when using pictures. 

When I started this project I had no idea where it would go, or that it'd still be growing years later. If I had tried to cram Briars into a traditional structure, like a photo essay, things would have fallen apart ages ago.

## Touchscreen?

Although the first 3 years-worth of images were made with cell phones, I  switched to a hand-me-down Nikon point and shoot. It has an optical zoom. Most importantly, I can quickly adjust exposure settings using control wheels without having to take off my work gloves.

It's a surprisingly hardy little camera. It's survived a toothy kiss from a copperhead, cow snot, and the usual heat, dust and rain, too. I keep the camera close by – either stowed in a ziplock bag in my pocket, or in a small Pelican case alongside my tools – because a camera is useless if you don't have it when you need it.



## Keep learning

In addition to the usual field guides, [iNaturalist,](https://www.inaturalist.org/) as well as the Texas Master Naturalists and Ag extension have been great resources for learning more about the ecosystem processes happening in front of me.



## Recharge

When feel like I can't possibly come up with another picture, I flip through that [notebook](https://www.zachmccabe.com/briars/about-briars.html#backstory) and ask myself how Qi Baishi might see the view.

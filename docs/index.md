Briars is 1 part diary, 1 part social publishing experiment.

Call it what you like – meditation, gratitude, delight. I do this to remind myself of the remarkable world right in front of me. Figured I’d bring a few friends along for the ride.

Notes on my process and what I've learned are coming soon.

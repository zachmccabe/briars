<span class="lede">Briars is 1 part diary, 1 part social publishing experiment.</span>

Call it what you like – meditation, gratitude, delight. I do this to remind myself of the remarkable world right in front of me. Figured I’d bring a few friends along for the ride.

## Why all this?

The idea here is that headspace is where you make it. So, the question becomes *how* do you make it?

The answer, for me, usually starts out in the nearest overgrown field. Briars [started out] as a nature diary. Since then, I've learned that:

1. Honing your observation skills is a chance to build empathy, like a muscle.
2. When you do that, you gain wiggle room between crowded thoughts.
3. Use that muscle, and you find headspace.

Mindfulness is a thing you must do -- not a thing you keep in a pocket.

Let's practice together. I have a long way to go and would love the company.

## What's next?

Briars is hopping over to an email newsletter. This new format has been a long time coming. What will it be like? Same but different:

The conversation here centers on everyday nature. Things are plenty wild when you sit in last year's garden, or a scrap of suburban woods, or under whatever dark sky is left. You'll see.

Cross-cultural communication comes into the conversation, too. Turns out "nature" here doesn't feel so natural in some other places. (Again, break open a few assumptions, distort a few patterns = more headspace.)

And, since my brains are at their best after a hot day under the sun, expect full-tilt silliness.

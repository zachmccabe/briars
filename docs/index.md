Briars is 1 part diary, 1 part social publishing experiment.

Call it what you like – meditation, gratitude, delight. I do this to remind myself of the remarkable world right in front of me. Figured I’d bring a few friends along for the ride.

Want to know a secret? Big changes are coming to Briars. Email me and I'll update you: <a href="mailto:hello@zachmccabe.com?Subject=Tell%20me%20your%20secret,%20 dude">{{ page.email }}</a>

Notes on my process and what I've learned are coming soon.

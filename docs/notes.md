## Project inspiration

Briars is inspired by the ranch where I work as a hand, and by some of my favorite nature journals, too. Mostly, though, it was a chance visit with an old friend that got this project started, and keeps it moving.

During a visit to the US, my childhood Chinese teacher gave me a notebook filled with details from [Qi Bai Shi's] ink and brush paintings. (She's a business consultant now.)

Qi's crickets and cicadas were my favorite when I was a kid. His work was so different to anything I'd ever seen. It made me smile. It still does. When my teacher handed me that notebook, she gave me an idea and Briars got its start -- that was 7 years ago.

## Keeping it real

These pictures are made as a diary, and shared with friends via social channels. For Briars, like with any story, [nonfiction] is defined by the interaction between you, your subject and your audience.

The audience for this project started with friends in China. We grew up in some of the world's biggest cities, in a culture where the expectations surrounding agriculture and nature are different than in the Anglosphere.

This project is published using social platforms and instant messaging. (Briars initially went out to friends via direct message, then to WeChat and Instagram. I no longer use those 2 platforms but I am always tinkering with new venues for sharing the project.)

Viewed on a phone, these tiny images need to have low information density. I want a concise message and a composition that works at 600px 1:1 while, e.g.: the viewer is on her morning bus ride to work.

When I frame the scene, select one picture over another, or write a caption, I do my best to remember this. I want to keep it real.

## Researching the story

To learn more about the ecosystem processes happening in front of me I use field guides, [iNaturalist,] and [NRCS pubs.] Studying natural history helps me make meaningful pictures. It improves my chances of being in the right place at the right time, too:

- Stay low and don't silhouette when photographing bees, climbing snakes, wasps and other creatures that are preyed on by birds.
- Move softly and deliberately. This is critical when working around things that bite, kick, or shove back.
- To the best of my judgement, I always prioritize the creature's welfare. Sometimes this means walking away without a photo. This post from ILCP is a [good way into that topic.]

## Structuring the story

New for this project is the atomic unit method. 

This modularization strategy is used in design as a way to scale up efficiently. A friend, who is a designer, suggested I look up Brad Frost and experiment with [his method.]

The idea is to divide information and interfaces down into their most basic pieces, and build out from those elements. See this article at [A List Apart] for more.

For Briars, the atomic unit is defined as a diary entry -- a picture and any notes I'll need for caption writing. It's not so different from the classic image-plus-caption structure familiar to photojournalists.

What's new (to me) is how these units flow and scale. Structuring the story this way lets me:

- Jump between social media platforms.
- Switch between languages, i.e. Chinese and English.
- Scale up the project over time.

All the other stuff I use is grouped into separate structures, e.g.: 

- Finished captions are a discrete atomic unit of their own; the content, tone and language vary.
- Reference pictures and video, which I use for looking up plant species in a botanical key.

The atomic unit is a powerful conceptual tool that's helped me to organize this multi-platform story. Briars wouldn't have grown without it.

Of course, this story form is everywhere now, thanks to the remarkable success of social media platforms. It feels like the default. But I still remember trying to wrap my head around this [2009 blog post] explaining NPR's "create once, publish everywhere" strategy the first time I read it.

## Publishing workflow

1. Briars is shot with an emphasis on quick turn around. Pictures are nearly always shot as JPG, then cropped 1:1 in Photo Mechanic on my Mac. Any notes or captions are stored in plaintext files alongside the images.

2. Everything gets moved to my phone so it can be published via mobile apps. I use Syncthing between Mac and Android. Previously, I used Dropbox.

3. Because social platforms optimize image dimensions and file size on their servers, I simply upload a big 1:1 crop of the image so there is plenty of data to use. I don't scale the image down or compress it. For this website I use Nik Output Sharpener on my Mac to prep the scaled-down JPG files.




## Tools and cameras

Portability matters with this project. The technical aspects of image quality are less important. Generally, I only use whatever photo gear I can fit in my pockets.

### Cameras

The first 3-years-worth of images were made with cell phones and a cheap action camera. Then, I switched to a hand-me-down Nikon compact. Right now, I'm using a secondhand Sony RX100.

I use either a 4x7" Loksak bag or a tiny, #1010 Pelican case to add some protection from sweat, dust and rain.

One useful thing about working with phones and compact cameras is that you don't need to look through a viewfinder. You get to keep your peripheral vision.

### Light

For quick closeups I use a small flashlight. It's the kind of thing you need routinely when you work outside, so just I upgraded what I already had.

For the past few years I've been using Jaxman E3 lights, which I run on 1x NIMH AA batteries. I use both the 4000K and 5700K Nichia versions of this light. Each is rated at 90 CRI.

I also keep a collapsible reflector in my car but I've only used it once. Cattle, in particulary, really hate that thing. Camera flash isn't much better. Many critters are more willing to accommodate continuous light, I've found.

Updated: {% include print_update.html %} • Explaining my creative and technical process. Briars is now well into its 7th year. Measured in time or by image volume, this is the biggest photo project I’ve ever attempted.

## Project inspiration

The project is inspired by the ranch where I work as a hand, and by some of my favorite nature journals.

During a visit to the US, my childhood Chinese teacher (who is a jet-setting consultant these days) gave me a notebook filled with details from [Qi Bai Shi's] ink and brush paintings.

As a kid, Qi's crickets and cicadas were my favorite. His work was so different to anything I'd ever seen. It made me smile. It still does. When my old teacher handed me that notebook, she gave me an idea -- and Briars got its start.

Even now, when feel like I can't possibly come up with another picture, I flip through that notebook and ask myself how Qi Baishi might see the view.

## Keeping it real

These pictures are made as a diary, and shared with friends via social channels. For Briars, like with any story, [nonfiction] is defined by how you interact with: 1. Your subject, and 2. Your audience.

The primary audience for this project is friends in China. We grew up in some of the world's biggest cities, in a culture where the expectations surrounding agriculture and nature are different than in the Anglosphere.

This project is published through social platforms and instant messaging. (Initially, this project went out to friends via direct message, then to friends on WeChat and Instagram. I no longer use those 2 platforms but I am always tinkering with new venues for sharing the project.)

Viewed on a phone, these small scale images need to have low information density -- I want a concise message and a composition that works at 600px 1:1 while, e.g. the viewer is on her morning bus ride to work. There is no time for precious subtlety in that environment.

When I frame the scene, select one picture over another, or write a caption I do my best to remember this. I want to keep it real.

## Researching the story

In addition to the usual field guides, [iNaturalist,] NRCS pubs and the local Ag extension have been great resources for learning more about the ecosystem processes happening in front of me.

Studying natural history helps me make meaningful pictures. It improves my chances of being in the right place at the right time, too:

- Stay low and don't silhouette when photographing bees, climbing snakes, wasps and other creatures that are preyed on by birds.
- When working in close proximity to things that bite, kick, or shove back, work with deliberate, slow movements. One useful thing about working with phones and compact cameras is that you don't need to look through a viewfinder. I focus on physical proximity to my subject and the creature's body language. I trust the composition will be good enough.

## Structuring the story

New for this project is the "atomic unit" structure. 

This was suggested to me by a friend, who is a designer. This model is used in design as a way to scale up efficiently. The idea is to divide information and interfaces down into their most basic pieces and build out from those elements. See this article at [A List Apart] for more.

With Briars, the atomic unit is simply a dairy entry -- one picture and any notes I'll need for caption writing.

The idea might be a physics metaphor but it reminds me of convergent evolution. (You can't look at the contemporary web without seeing this pattern everywhere.) But could a model for the design process be used for creating content? When I adopted this model to organize my project, I hoped to:

- Jump between social media platforms.
- Switch between languages, i.e. Chinese and English.
- Scale the project up over time.

The atomic unit has become an invaluable conceptual tool for Briars. This project wouldn't have have grown without it.

## Publishing workflow

1. Briars is shot with an emphasis on quick turn around. Pictures are nearly always shot as JPG, then cropped 1:1 in Photo Mechanic on my Mac. Any notes or captions are stored in TXT files alongside the images.

2. Everything gets moved to my phone so it can be published via mobile apps. I use Syncthing between Mac and Android. Previously, I used Dropbox.

Because social platforms employ their own algorithms to optimize images, I simply give them a full-resolution, 1:1 crop of the image so there is plenty of data to use. However, for this website, I use Nik Output Sharpener on my Mac to prep the scaled-down JPG files.



## Tools and cameras

Portability matters with this project; the technical aspects of image quality less so.

### Cameras

The first 3 years-worth of images were made with cell phones and a cheap action camera. Then, I switched to a hand-me-down Nikon compact. Right now, I'm using a secondhand Sony RX100.

I keep the camera close by -- either stowed in a Loksak bag in my pocket, or in a small Pelican case alongside my tools. It’s probably obvious but electronics don’t like sweat, dust or having fence posts dropped on them.

There have been a handful of times that I've brought out a "big" camera to get a pre-planned shot. Generally, though, if it doesn't fit in my pockets, I don't bring it out.

### Light

Sometimes I wait for better light. Sometimes bring light with me.

I keep a collapsible reflector in my car but I've only used it once. Cows hate that thing. Camera flash also spooks them. Both cattle and snakes are more willing to accommodate continuous light.

For quick closeups, I always carry a small flashlight with high CRI output. This light still irritates some critters, e.g. cicadas, caterpillars and scorpions. To the best of my judgement, I always prioritize the creature's welfare. Sometimes this means walking away without a photo.

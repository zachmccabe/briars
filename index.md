If you could take a snapshot of a scent, what would you pick?

When we were kids we took that road trip with Aunt Ginger. We stopped to buy a giant, prickly jackfruit. We brought it along in the car, all the way from Ruili to Deqin. I want a snapshot of the 2nd day – but not the 3rd day.

Jackfruit has this chewy sweetness that sticks to everything I remember: The rhododendron forests. The summer storms.

In the rainy season the mountains fall apart. Rain sluices downhill with mud and rock and feeds the Salween. The stink of jackfruit doesn't wash off my sweaty face. I don't really want to wash it off. (Do you remember that syrup-looking, crazy river? It was churning and bubbling like a fancy, Hong Kong latte.)

If you could keep a scent for yourself – to breathe in a quick sniff when you feel so far away from what you know – what would you keep?

On my first day back at the ranch, the bull headbutts me in the chest.

He isn't evil. He is just old and impatient. And I am in his way. He is bigger than me. He is dangerously larger than me; he probably weighs as much as my old Toyota. I smack his cheek, this turns into a hug as he pushes his head into my chest again. Then, I'm scrambling on all fours – getting out of the way – and I notice that he's got blue eyes. I've never noticed that before.

I laugh. I swear at him, “just trying to get you into that tasty, tall grass, you grouch.”

He can smell that tall grass. He doesn't want my help.

"Watch out for that bull," my boss' son warns me later. When he chases you, run in a zig zag to the nearest tree. "The nearest tree?" I ask, squinting at the open fields. Everybody here has been treed by a bull.

The bull is the same color as the clay under these fields. (A few miles from here, a brick maker tore up all the ancient oaks, the fields of grama grass and little bluestem to mine the red stuff.)

Summer heat bakes the moisture out of the clay. (You don't want to have to dig post holes in the summer. Believe me.) Summer heat bakes the fields and it feels like you can smell that last drop of rain cooking right out of the grass. Before noon, the oils in the juniper, ragweed and prickly ash are rising as clean as temple incense. The scent is delicious.

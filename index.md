Briars is 1 part diary, 1 part social publishing experiment.

I do this to remind myself of the remarkable worlds that are right in front of me. Call it whatever you like -- meditation, gratitude, delight. Figured I could bring a few friends along for the ride.

Briars is now well into its 6th year (2019). Measured in time or by image volume, this is the biggest photo project I've ever attempted.

Initially, this project went out to friends via direct message, then to friends on WeChat and Instagram. I no longer use those 2 platforms but I am always tinkering with new venues for sharing the project.

If you could take a snapshot of a scent, what would you pick?

I'd pick this time when we were kids, road tripping with Aunt Ginger: we'd stopped to buy a giant, prickly jackfruit. Do you remember? We brought it along in the car, all the way from Ruili to Deqin. I want a snapshot of the 2nd day – but not the 3rd day.

Jackfruit has this chewy sweetness that sticks to everything else I remember: The rhododendron forests. The summer storms.

Rainy season bathes the mountains. Rain sluices downhill with mud and rock and feeds the Salween. (Do you remember that syrup-looking, crazy river – churning and bubbling like a fancy, Hong Kong latte?) The stink of jackfruit doesn't wash off my sweaty face. I don't really want to wash it off.

If you could keep a scent for yourself – to breathe in a quick sniff when you feel so far away from what you know – what would you choose?

On my first day back at the ranch, the bull headbutts me in the chest.

He isn't evil, just old and impatient. And I am in his way. He is dangerously bigger than me; he probably weighs as much as my old Toyota. I smack his cheek while scrambling to get out of the way.

I laugh. I swear at him, “just trying to get you into that tasty, tall grass, you grouch.”

He can smell that tall grass and he doesn't want my help.

"Watch out for that bull," my boss' son warns me later.

The bull is the same color as the clay under these fields. A few miles from here, a brick maker tore up all the oaks and fields of grama grass and little bluestem to mine the red stuff.

Summer heat bakes the moisture out of the clay. (You don't want to have to dig post holes in the summer. Believe me.) Summer heat bakes the fields and you can smell the last drop of rain cook out of the grass. Before noon, the oils in the juniper, ragweed and prickly ash are rising as clean as temple incense. The scent is delicious.

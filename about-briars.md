"You work on a ranch? *Why?*"

Briars is now well into its 6th year. Measured in time or by image volume, this is the biggest photo project I've ever attempted.

I guess 'why' has been a hard question to answer.

<div style="margin:5em auto">
<p><img src="https://www.zachmccabe.com/briars/assets/viz/5.jpg" alt="cicada on an oak" /></p>
<p><img src="https://www.zachmccabe.com/briars/assets/viz/8.jpg" alt="winter oak" /></p>
</div>

Briars is equal parts diary and social publishing experiment. 

Originally, images went out to friends via direct message, then to friends on WeChat and Instagram. I no longer use the latter 2 platforms, but I am always tinkering with new venues for sharing the project.

Meanwhile, I'm still making the pictures:

- Images are photographed in the vicinity of the ranch. See: [work fast.](https://www.zachmccabe.com/briars/lessons-learned.html#work-fast)
- All images from the project are made within my definition of [nonfiction.](https://www.zachmccabe.com/nonfiction)

Briars is equal parts diary and social publishing experiment. 

- All images from the project are made within my definition of [nonfiction.](https://www.zachmccabe.com/nonfiction)
- Images are photographed in the vicinity of the ranch. See: [work fast.](https://www.zachmccabe.com/briars/lessons-learned.html#work-fast)

Briars is now well into its 6th year (2019). Measured in time or by image volume, this is the biggest photo project I've ever attempted.

Initially, this project went out to friends via direct message, then to friends on WeChat and Instagram. I no longer use those 2 platforms, but I am always tinkering with new venues for sharing the project.

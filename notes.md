{% include print_update.html %} • "You work on a ranch? *But why?*"

Briars is now well into its 7th year (2020). Measured in time or by image volume, this is the biggest photo project I’ve ever attempted.

I guess it's been a hard question to answer.

## The process I use

These pictures are made as a diary, shared with friends via social channels. Pictures are made on the ranch where I work as a hand, or nearby. The project is [nonfiction.]

[nonfiction.]: https://www.zachmccabe.com/nonfiction



## Keeping a diary

For Briars, like with any story, nonfiction is defined by how you interact with 1. Your subject, and 2. Your audience.

I am a ranch hand. Physically altering the landscape is my job. My human and gasoline smells, my noisy tools my daily interaction with the place changes the behavior of the plants and animals that live here.

This is a ranch. I spend quality time with the cattle. Having them know me makes it much safer for all of us to share this space day in and out.

Likewise being here changes my behavior. That's part of the story.

All this needs to be obvious in the pictures and captions. The bulk of this project has been published through social platforms -- and there is no time for precious subtleties in that environment.

The primary audience for this project is friends in China. We grew up in some of the world's biggest cities, in a culture where the expectations surrounding agriculture and nature are different than in the Anglosphere.

When I select a picture or write a caption I do my best to remember this. I want to keep it real.



## Working fast

This project has a funny relationship with time.

When I'm at the ranch, work doesn't stop for good light. I’m not there to take pictures. That’s a privilege, not my job.

Work doesn't stop for the photogenic moments: The bobcat quiet as a ghost in the tall grass; The first morning the grama grass blossoms; The supercell building on the horizon.

I make time for pictures during a break, or after I’m done working for the day.

Moments appear and then disappear like that bobcat. I have to work fast.

One of the challenges with the project is telling my story using subjects that don’t scare off. Farm work can get pretty loud. (I still haven't managed to photograph the resident bobcat. Herons, turkeys and owls are aloof creatures who love quiet, and will fly off as soon as they see me; Yellowbelly racers are worthy of the name; Copperheads, thankfully, like to sit still.)

Some things can be photographed off the ranch, too. Subjects like storm clouds can be photograph from nearby roads. Wild plants and animals can be photographed in local nature preserves.

Few of the photos that I publish in Briars were made when I first encounter a subject. Many are made seasons later. I’ve got time.

Because this is a diary, I can often puzzle through an idea or scene day after day, season after season.



## Project inspiration

During a visit to the US, my childhood Chinese teacher gives me a notebook filled with details from [Qi Bai Shi's] ink and brush paintings.

As a kid, Qi's crickets and cicadas were my favorite. His work was so different to anything I'd ever seen. It made me smile. It still does.

My teacher didn't know anything about that but when she handed me that notebook, she gave me an idea.

When feel like I can't possibly come up with another picture, I flip through that notebook and ask myself how Qi Baishi might see the view.

## Structuring the story

New for this project is the "atomic unit" structure. 

This was suggested to me by a friend, who is a designer. This model is used in design as a way to scale up efficiently. The idea is to divide information and interfaces down into their most basic pieces and build out from those elements -- hence the physics metaphor.

*(See this article at [A List Apart](https://alistapart.com/article/language-of-modular-design) for more.)*

"Sounds cool," I said to my friend, "but how the hell do I make a story this way?" The idea reminded of glyphs in Chinese characters, or Le Corbusier. "Just try it," he laughed. At this point it just reminds me of <???evolution> because I can't *not* see this form everywhere in web-based media: From Tweets and Tumblr blogs; singles released on Spotify and Sound Cloud; and the frontend of ecommerce platforms like Etsy and Shoppify. There are endless examples. Now it's a familiar internet pattern but, a few years ago, it felt a little crazy to me.

With Briars, the atomic unit is simply a dairy entry – one picture and any notes I'll need for caption writing. When I adopted this model to organize my project, I hoped to:

- Jump between social media platforms, i.e. Instagram, WeChat etc.
- Switch between languages, i.e. Chinese and English.
- Scale the project up over time.

The atomic unit has become an invaluable conceptual tool for Briars. When I think back to that conversation, I smile. This project wouldn't have have grown without it.

## How I make Briars

Always be flexible. If Zen is the goal, my big takeaway from this project is to be flexible: flexible in what subjects I get to photograph; flexible with the tools and techniques I use, as social platforms have changed *a lot* since I started publishing Briars.

### Publishing workflow

Initially, this project went out to friends via direct message, then to friends on WeChat and Instagram. I no longer use those 2 platforms but I am always tinkering with new venues for sharing the project.

1. Pictures are shot as JPG, then cropped 1:1 in Photo Mechanic. Any notes or captions are stored in TXT files alongside the images.

2. Everything gets moved to my phone so it can be published via mobile apps. I use Syncthing. 
Previously, I uploaded everything to Dropbox.

### Keep learning

In addition to the usual field guides, [iNaturalist,](https://www.inaturalist.org/), as well as the Texas Master Naturalists and Ag extension have been great resources for learning more about the ecosystem processes happening in front of me.

Learning a little natural history helps me make meaningful pictures. Knowing something about the behavior of cattle and the wild things here improves my chances of being in the right place at the right time:

- Stay low and don't silhouette when photographing bees, climbing snakes, wasps and other creatures that are preyed on by birds.

- When working in close proximity to things that bite, kick, or shove back, work with deliberate, slow movements.

- One useful thing about working with phones and compact cameras is that you don't need to look through a viewfinder. I focus on physical proximity to my subject and the creature's body language. I trust the composition will be good enough.

### Tools and cameras

Portability matters with this project. The technical aspects of image quality less so.

There have been a handful of times that I've brought out a "big" camera to get a pre-planned shot. Generally, though, if it doesn't fit in my pockets, I don't bring it out.

For the publishing requirements of my project, these limitations are fine. (After all, when I started this project, Instagram images were 600px 1:1. WeChat didn't publish a spec but, based on my own testing, dimensions on that platform were even smaller.)

Because this is a diary, there is no work in post unless I shot using the wrong white balance and need to adjust for that.

### Cameras

The first 3 years-worth of images were made with cell phones and a cheap action camera. Then, I switched to a hand-me-down Nikon compact. Right now, I'm using a secondhand Sony.

I keep the camera close by – either stowed in a Loksak bag in my pocket, or in a small Pelican case alongside my tools. It’s probably obvious but electronics don’t like sweat, dust or having fence posts dropped on them.

### Light

Sometimes I wait for better light. Sometimes bring light with me.

I keep a collapsible reflector in my car but I've only used it once. Cows hate that thing. Camera flash also spooks them. Both cattle and snakes are more willing to accommodate continuous light.

For quick closeups, I always carry a small flashlight with high CRI output. It's a handy tool at the ranch, anyway.

This light still irritates some critters -- like cicadas, caterpillars and scorpions. To the best of my judgement, I always prioritize the creature's welfare -- even when it means walking away without a photo.

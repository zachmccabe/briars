Updated: {% include print_update.html %} • Explaining my creative and technical process.

Briars is [nonfiction.] These pictures are made as a diary. The project is inspired by the ranch where I work as a hand, and by some of my favorite nature journals. The project is shared with friends via social channels.

"You work on a ranch? But *why*?"

Maybe that's been a hard question to answer. Briars is now well into its 7th year (2020). Measured in time or by image volume, this is the biggest photo project I’ve ever attempted.

## Keeping a diary

For Briars, like with any story, nonfiction is defined by how you interact with: 1. Your subject, and 2. Your audience.

The primary audience for this project is friends in China. We grew up in some of the world's biggest cities, in a culture where the expectations surrounding agriculture and nature are different than in the Anglosphere.

The bulk of this project has been published through social platforms -- and there is no time for precious subtleties in that environment.

When I frame the scene, select one picture over another, or write a caption I do my best to remember this. I want to keep it real.



## Project inspiration

During a visit to the US, my childhood Chinese teacher gave me a notebook filled with details from [Qi Bai Shi's] ink and brush paintings.

As a kid, Qi's crickets and cicadas were my favorite. His work was so different to anything I'd ever seen. It made me smile. It still does.

My teacher didn't know anything about that but when she handed me that notebook, she gave me an idea.

Even now, when feel like I can't possibly come up with another picture, I flip through that notebook and ask myself how Qi Baishi might see the view.

## Researching the story

In addition to the usual field guides, and [iNaturalist,] Texas Master Naturalists and the Ag extension have been great resources for learning more about the ecosystem processes happening in front of me.

Studying natural history helps me make meaningful pictures. It improves my chances of being in the right place at the right time, too:

- Stay low and don't silhouette when photographing bees, climbing snakes, wasps and other creatures that are preyed on by birds.

- When working in close proximity to things that bite, kick, or shove back, work with deliberate, slow movements.

- One useful thing about working with phones and compact cameras is that you don't need to look through a viewfinder. I focus on physical proximity to my subject and the creature's body language. I trust the composition will be good enough.

## Structuring the story

New for this project is the "atomic unit" structure. 

This was suggested to me by a friend, who is a designer. This model is used in design as a way to scale up efficiently. The idea is to divide information and interfaces down into their most basic pieces and build out from those elements -- hence the physics metaphor.

For more, see this article at [A List Apart.](https://alistapart.com/article/language-of-modular-design)

With Briars, the atomic unit is simply a dairy entry – one picture and any notes I'll need for caption writing.

When I adopted this model to organize my project, I hoped to:

- Jump between social media platforms.
- Switch between languages, i.e. Chinese and English.
- Scale the project up over time.

The atomic unit has become an invaluable conceptual tool for Briars. This project wouldn't have have grown without it.



## Publishing workflow

1. Pictures are shot as JPG, then cropped 1:1 in Photo Mechanic. Any notes or captions are stored in TXT files alongside the images.

2. Everything gets moved to my phone so it can be published via mobile apps. I use Syncthing. Previously, I uploaded everything to Dropbox.

Initially, this project went out to friends via direct message, then to friends on WeChat and Instagram. I no longer use those 2 platforms but I am always tinkering with new venues for sharing the project.



## Tools and cameras

Portability matters with this project. The technical aspects of image quality less so.

### Cameras

The first 3 years-worth of images were made with cell phones and a cheap action camera. Then, I switched to a hand-me-down Nikon compact. Right now, I'm using a secondhand Sony RX100.

I keep the camera close by – either stowed in a Loksak bag in my pocket, or in a small Pelican case alongside my tools. It’s probably obvious but electronics don’t like sweat, dust or having fence posts dropped on them.

There have been a handful of times that I've brought out a "big" camera to get a pre-planned shot. Generally, though, if it doesn't fit in my pockets, I don't bring it out.

### Light

Sometimes I wait for better light. Sometimes bring light with me.

I keep a collapsible reflector in my car but I've only used it once. Cows hate that thing. Camera flash also spooks them. Both cattle and snakes are more willing to accommodate continuous light.

For quick closeups, I always carry a small flashlight with high CRI output. It's a handy tool at the ranch, anyway.

This light still irritates some critters -- like cicadas, caterpillars and scorpions. To the best of my judgement, I always prioritize the creature's welfare -- even when it means walking away without a photo.
